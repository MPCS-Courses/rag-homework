# Software Engineering Principles

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. Creational patterns (Factory, Singleton) handle object creation. Structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator) organize classes and objects. Behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy) define communication between objects.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID principles guide object-oriented design:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class should have one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Agile Development

Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and responding to change. Scrum and Kanban are popular frameworks. Key practices include daily standups, sprint planning, and continuous integration.

## Testing Strategies

Unit tests verify individual components. Integration tests check component interactions. End-to-end tests validate complete workflows. Test-driven development (TDD) writes tests before implementation code.

## Code Quality

Maintainable code is readable, well-documented, and follows consistent style. Code reviews help catch bugs and share knowledge. Refactoring improves code structure without changing functionality.
