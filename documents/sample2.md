# Introduction to RAG Systems

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval and text generation.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Processing**: Chunk documents and convert them to vectors
2. **Vector Storage**: Store vectors in a vector database
3. **Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant document chunks based on user questions
4. **Generation**: Use retrieved documents as context to generate answers with large language models

## Advantages of RAG

- Can answer questions based on the latest document content
- Reduces model hallucinations
- Can trace answer sources
- Supports long document processing

## Common Application Scenarios

- Enterprise knowledge base Q&A
- Intelligent document retrieval
- Customer service chatbots
- Academic research assistants
