Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run in browsers.

Frontend development focuses on the user interface and user experience. Technologies include HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Modern frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular help build complex single-page applications.

Backend development handles server-side logic, database interactions, and API design. Common technologies include Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), and Ruby on Rails. RESTful APIs and GraphQL are popular approaches for data exchange.

Full-stack developers work on both frontend and backend components. They understand the entire web development stack and can build complete applications from database to user interface.

Web development best practices include:
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Security considerations (HTTPS, input validation, authentication)
- Performance optimization (caching, code minification, CDN usage)
- Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance)
- Version control and collaborative development workflows
