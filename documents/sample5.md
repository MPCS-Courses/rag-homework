# Database Systems Overview

## Relational Databases

Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, using SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulation.

Key concepts include:
- Tables: Collections of related data
- Primary Keys: Unique identifiers for each row
- Foreign Keys: References to other tables
- Normalization: Organizing data to reduce redundancy

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases provide alternative data storage models:
- Document databases (MongoDB): Store data as documents
- Key-value stores (Redis): Simple key-value pairs
- Column-family stores (Cassandra): Optimized for large-scale data
- Graph databases (Neo4j): Store relationships between entities

## Database Indexing

Indexes improve query performance by creating data structures that allow faster data retrieval. Common index types include B-tree indexes, hash indexes, and full-text indexes.

## ACID Properties

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensures reliable database transactions:
- Atomicity: All operations succeed or fail together
- Consistency: Database remains in a valid state
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- Durability: Committed changes persist
